RM1|Front Gate Courtyard|You stand before the towering iron gate, its bars blackened with rust and streaked with something darker. The lock is fused shut, a heavy chain coiled around it like a serpent. Even if you had the strength, the metal looks as though it has become part of the stone wall itself — immovable, unbreakable. When you press your hand against the cold iron, a vibration hums faintly, as though the gate is alive, or listening. The fog beyond swirls against the bars, thicker and darker than anywhere else, hiding whatever lies outside from sight. Scratched into the stone at eye level are the faint words: “No Return.”|N:RM2

RM7|First Floor Bathroom|The cracked mirror reflects only a warped shadow of your face. The tub is filled with foul, stagnant water that drips onto the tiles with a steady rhythm.|N:RM13
RM8|Stairwell|The wooden steps creak as if protesting your weight. Scratches run deep along the banister, far too wide to be human.|E:RM9,W:RM5

RM10|Master Bedroom|The four-poster bed is still made, sheets untouched yet riddled with dark stains. A music box sits on the dresser, playing on its own, though its key is broken.|W:RM9(l)
RM11|Sunroom|Tall glass panes are fogged from the inside, smeared with handprints that fade into streaks. Plants sit withered in their pots, nothing but brittle husks twisting toward a dead sky.|N:RM19(l),S:RM6
RM12|Dining Room|A massive oak table stretches across the room, scarred with deep scratches and dark stains. Faded, moth-eaten chairs lean at odd angles, as if abandoned mid-meal.|E:RM13,S:RM5
RM13|Kitchen|The stench of rotted meat and blood-soaked rags suffocates the air. Knives remain embedded in the cutting block, their edges wet with something fresher than the rest.|S:RM7,W:RM12

RM18|Balcony|The wooden railings are weak with rot, overlooking the sprawling fog below. Something stirs in the mist, circling… waiting.|N:RM16
RM19|Overgrown Backyard|Twisted vines and thorned bushes fill the yard. The ground sinks underfoot as if breathing. A rusted swing sways slowly, though the air is still.|N:RM22(l),E:RM21,S:RM11(l),W:RM20
RM20|Old Storage Shed|Tools hang rusted on the walls, many missing. The floor is littered with muddy footprints that stop suddenly in the center of the room.|E:RM19
